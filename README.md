# tapsi

Hi everyone 
This is one of the first projects that I had done when studying HTML and CSS. This project is about the main page of the tapsi website. 

This project is total with HTML and CSS and some javascript that is needed for the hamburger menu. 
Tapsi is one of the most famous businesses in Iran that operates in the field of transportation. tapsi has a beautiful main page that is helpful for beginners to have a good project. I used Flex, Grid, and Media query for
 this project.
